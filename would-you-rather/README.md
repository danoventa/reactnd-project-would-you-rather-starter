# Would You Rather Project
This is my submission for Udacity's nanodegree project, "Would you rather". You're asked a series of community driven questions with two options. Once you've selected your option for each question, you'll be able to see what the rest of the community has decided. 

Other features:
1. Create new questions to ask other users, and answer yourself. 
2. View the leaderboard, showing the placement of the users in the community based on their responses and question contributions.
